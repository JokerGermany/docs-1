# Introduction
This book contains the documentation for all my Matrix bridges. The book is
built using [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). The source code is
available in the [mautrix/docs](https://github.com/mautrix/docs) repo.

These docs are mostly targeted towards people who want to run bridges themselves.
If you don't want to self-host, some bridges have public instances available
(listed on the page of each bridge). [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) also
offers all of these bridges as a service.
